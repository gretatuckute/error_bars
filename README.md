# Error bars lab meeting presentation

error_bars.Rmd - source file containing all text & code for the presentation. You may need to install some new R packages to run the code (see the `library()` commands early in the file). The file should run and compile quickly, in a few seconds.

error_bars.html - compiled slides used for presentation.
